    <p>My name is Kailyne Perez, i am 14 years old and im a Freshman in Inwood Early College for Health and Technologies.  When i first started school here at Inwood i didn't really know anything about what i wanted to do in the future nether did i want to go to college, but ive kinda figured it out now. What i wanna do is study criminology or crimal justice to then help me get the job as a criminal technician or a crime scene investigator. But other then that i have many  hobbies and other goals that i wanna reach. I play many instraments which are the electric guitar, the drums, bass guitar, and a little bit of keyboard and a goal of mine is i wanna get better and learn more songs and etc. I also wanna work to be able to make money and also get more experience so i can get more job oppertunities. Things that i like doing is playing my instraments, going out to new places or just being outside, listening to music even making beats once in a while, and i like talking with people because to me i think i am a very nice person to talk to. In middle i also earned many awards, i've got High Honer roll for the hole 7th and 8th grade of middle school, ive also gotten over 5 music awards, i also was givin a big oppertunitiy to take the U.S history regent early. ive had teachers tell me that im very outgoing, smart, kind and that im good at working with people and im good at making my point but also good at listening to otehrs views.</p>
